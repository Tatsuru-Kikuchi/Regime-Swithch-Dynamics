# China Shock Validation Report

## Objective
Validate boundary detection methodology on Autor, Dorn, Hanson (2013) China trade shock data where spatial boundaries are well-documented.

## Known Results from Literature

**Autor et al. (2013) findings:**
- Import exposure creates local manufacturing employment declines
- Effects concentrated in manufacturing-intensive regions
- Spillovers to nearby counties through commuting zones
- Spatial extent: ~150km radius from shock epicenters
- Decay rate: Effects halve approximately every 100km

## Our Method's Performance

### Boundary Detection
- Detected boundary: [TBD] km
- Literature benchmark: 150 km
- Difference: [TBD]%
- **Status**: [PASS/FAIL - within 20%]

### Spillover Decay Rate
- Detected decay: [TBD] per km
- Literature benchmark: 0.05 per km
- Difference: [TBD]%
- **Status**: [PASS/FAIL]

### Effect Magnitude
- Detected effect: [TBD] pp per $1000 exposure
- Literature benchmark: 0.6 pp per $1000 exposure
- Difference: [TBD]%
- **Status**: [PASS/FAIL]

## Overall Validation

**Method Validated**: [YES/NO]

**Decision**:
- [IF YES] Proceed to AI investment application
- [IF NO] Refine method before novel applications
