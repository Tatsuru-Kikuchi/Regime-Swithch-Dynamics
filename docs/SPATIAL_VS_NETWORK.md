# Spatial vs Network Boundaries: Conceptual Distinction

## The Confusion

Your earlier framework conflated two different types of propagation:
1. **Spatial**: Effects spread through geographic proximity
2. **Network**: Effects spread through relationships

These have different:
- Theoretical foundations
- Empirical patterns
- Policy implications

## Spatial Boundaries

**Mechanism**: Geographic spillovers
- Local labor markets
- Knowledge diffusion
- Commuting zones

**Measurement**: Distance in kilometers

**Example**: Manufacturing decline spreads to nearby towns through shared labor markets

## Network Boundaries

**Mechanism**: Relationship-based propagation
- Supply chain connections
- Buyer-supplier links
- Contractual obligations

**Measurement**: Graph distance (hops)

**Example**: Firm bankruptcy affects direct suppliers, then suppliers' suppliers

## Why This Matters

If you conflate them:
- Cannot identify true mechanism
- Policy recommendations misleading
- Theory development confused

## Our Approach

1. Model spatial boundaries first (China shock)
2. Model network boundaries separately (bankruptcy data)
3. Test if they interact
4. Only combine if empirically justified

## Example Comparison

**Spatial**: "AI effects spread to firms within 50km"
→ Policy: Target geographic clusters

**Network**: "AI effects spread to direct suppliers"
→ Policy: Target supply chain partners

These require DIFFERENT policies!
